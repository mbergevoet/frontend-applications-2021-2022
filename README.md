# :fax: About the API

For this course I'm using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). This API is and open REST API which means you don't need a key to access it. But because it's free you only get 10.000 requests per day. That's still a lot of requests but there is a limit.\
Obiously the API returns JSON String data which I can use to inject it into a HTML page.\
Unfortunatly for me, the API hasn't been updated since 2014. Because of that the newer Star Wars movies aren't available so there isn't as much content.\
<br> Down below I've written examples of possible endpoints and URL's. \

Base URL:

> https://swapi.dev/api/

Example requests:

> https://swapi.dev/api/films/

> https://swapi.dev/api/people/

> https://swapi.dev/api/planets/

> https://swapi.dev/api/species/

> https://swapi.dev/api/starships/

> https://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/

Example single request:

> https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/
